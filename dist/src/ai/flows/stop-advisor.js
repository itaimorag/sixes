You will receive information about the current game state, including the player's estimated score, the scores of other players, and the number of cards remaining in the deck and discard pile.

Based on this information, you will provide advice on whether the player should call 'STOP'.

Here is the information about the current game state:

My estimated score: {{{myEstimatedScore}}}
Opponent scores: {{#each opponentScores}}{{{this}}} {{/each}}
Cards remaining in deck: {{{cardsRemainingInDeck}}}
Cards in discard pile: {{{cardsInDiscardPile}}}

Consider the following factors:

* The player's goal is to have the lowest score at the end of the game.
* Calling 'STOP' ends the game after all other players have one final turn.
* If the player calls 'STOP' and has the lowest score, they receive a bonus.
* If the player calls 'STOP' but another player has a lower score, they receive a penalty.
* The number of cards remaining in the deck and discard pile can influence the likelihood of other players improving their scores.

Based on these considerations, should the player call 'STOP'? Explain your reasoning.
